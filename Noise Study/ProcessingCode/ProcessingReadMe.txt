[Processing Code Folder]
	This folder contain Processing3 codes. The purpose of these code are to produce 
	the visual of the behavoir of the different algorithm. 
	I use this during the research process to better understand the algorithm.

	I was also not able to implemented the terrain generation in C++ in time
	so those are also done with processing in order to show better visual.
	

[Installing Processing]
	If you wish to run the processing code you can download the IDE here:
	https://processing.org/download/
	
	***Alternatively, the .gif version of the result of every code is also included so
	you do not need to get the IDE to view them. The Gif Are also included in the power point
	so that would be the easiest place to view them.

[Folder Contents]

The "ProcessingCode" folder contain the following:


1. [noise]
	- this is the code for Perlin and Simplex noise genration 
	Note:
		To see visual of Perlin noise uncomment line 31 and comment out line 32 in noise
		To see visual of Simplex noise uncomment line 32 and comment out line 31 in noise

2. [Perlin Movement]
	- this is the code for visualization of Perlin movement
	
3. [regRamdom]
	- this is the code for visualization of regular random movement

4.[TerrainGenerator]
	- this is the code for visualization of Terrain generation using Perlin and Simplex value

Note:

To see visual of Random Terrain uncomment line 34 
and comment out line 37,40 and 41 in TerrainGenerator

To see visual of Perlin Terrain uncomment line 37 
and comment out line 34, 40 and 41 in TerrainGenerator

To see visual of Simplex Terrain uncomment line 40 and 41 
and comment out line 34 and 37 in TerrainGenerator

Resulting Gif included in result slide and seperately.
