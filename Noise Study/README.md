*  Description of the program:
*******************************************************

The is a study of different type of noise use in computer graphic 
(Random noise, Perlin noise and Simplex noise) 

*******************************************************
[Noise_HeightMap]
	Contain the C++ code that produce heightmap using perlin and simplex algorithm

[ProcessingCode]
	This folder contain Processing3 codes. The purpose of these code are to produce 
	the visual of the behavoir of the different algorithm. 
	I use this during the research process to better understand the algorithm.

	I was also not able to implemented the terrain generation in C++ in time
	so those are also done with processing in order to show better visual.

[Result]
	Containing images result of the program execution. The powerpoint show Gif result
	from the animated demonstration. Please view in presentation mode. 

[Report]
	Word document discussing the result
