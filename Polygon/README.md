*  Description of the program:
*******************************************************

This program will interactively draws and fill in polygons.

Every time a user clicks the left mouse button, the program 
adds a vertex until the right button is pressed. Once the right
mouse click is press a polygon will be form and fill in.

Note that the intermediate process should be visible by displaying
vertices with a big point and drawing lines between vertices. 
The very last vertex and current cursor position should be connected 
with a rubber band line to display a possible line segment. 

*******************************************************
*  Circumstances of programs
*******************************************************

It was also developed, tested, compile and run 
on Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019

Line drawing, points displaying, rubberbanding and color fill work
as expected. 

The only issue I can see is that the first dot place isn't shown. 
I just ran out of time to fix it. 

Did not get to the resizing extra credit.
